    "# Problem Statement - San Francisco Crime Classification\n",
    "Predict the category of crimes that occurred in the city by the bay \n",
    "To examine the specific problem, we will apply a full Data Science life cycle composed of the following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Wrangling : to audit the quality of the data and perform all the necessary actions to clean the dataset.\n",
    "2. Data Exploration (EDA) : for understanding the predictors and create intuition on the data.\n",
    "3. Feature Engineering : to create additional predictors from the existing which are potentially more insightful.\n",
    "4. Data Normalization and Data Transformation : for preparing the dataset for learning algorithms (if needed).\n",
    "6. Training / Testing data creation : to evaluate the performance of our models and fine-tune their hyperparameters.\n",
    "7. Model selection and evaluation. This will be the final goal; creating a model that predicts the probability of each type of crime based on the location and the date."
